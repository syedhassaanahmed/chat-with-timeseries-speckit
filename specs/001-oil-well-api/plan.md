# Implementation Plan: Oil Well Time Series API

**Branch**: `001-oil-well-api` | **Date**: 2025-12-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-oil-well-api/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Public REST API serving synthetic oil well time-series data (2 years, 5 wells, 8 metrics) with raw and aggregated query endpoints. Built with Python 3.14 + FastAPI, using SQLite for storage, uv for package management, and ruff for linting. Provides minute-level raw data and daily/monthly aggregations for demonstration and testing purposes.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.14  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (latest), uvicorn (ASGI server), pydantic v2 (validation)  
**Storage**: SQLite (embedded database, indexed time-series tables)  
**Testing**: pytest, httpx (async HTTP client for API tests)  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (containerized via Dev Container)  
**Project Type**: Single backend API (no frontend)  
**Package Management**: uv (fast Python package installer and resolver)  
**Linting/Formatting**: ruff (fast Python linter and formatter)  
**Constraints**: Read-only API, no authentication, minute-level data granularity  
**Scale/Scope**: 5 sample wells, 8 metrics, ~2 years of data (~42M data points, ~1.26 GB)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **I. Simplicity & Clarity** | ✅ PASS | Single-purpose API with clear separation: data generation, business logic, API routes. SQLite eliminates external database complexity. FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI docs. |
| **II. Generic & Modular** | ✅ PASS | Modular structure: `models/` (entities), `services/` (business logic), `api/` (routes), `db/` (storage). New metrics/wells can be added via configuration without code changes. |
| **III. Transparency & Documentation** | ✅ PASS | OpenAPI specification auto-generated by FastAPI. Will create README with setup instructions, API usage examples, and architecture documentation. Inline docstrings for all functions. |
| **IV. Testing & Validation** | ✅ PASS | Will include: contract tests (OpenAPI compliance), integration tests (endpoint behavior), unit tests (aggregation logic). pytest with >80% coverage target. |
| **V. Open Collaboration** | ⚠️ DEFERRED | Will add CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in future PR. Initial implementation focuses on technical delivery. Ruff config ensures consistent code style. |
| **VI. Security & Data Privacy** | ✅ PASS | All data is synthetic (no real oilfield data). No authentication required (public API by design). Input validation via Pydantic models. No secrets or credentials in code. |
| **VII. Developer Experience** | ✅ PASS | MUST create .devcontainer/ configuration with Python 3.14, uv, ruff, and all dependencies. Dev Containers are non-negotiable per constitution. Will include complete devcontainer.json with features, extensions, and postCreateCommand. |

**Gate Decision**: ✅ PROCEED — One principle deferred to post-MVP (collaboration guidelines). Dev Container requirement is non-negotiable and will be implemented. Core technical principles satisfied.

### Post-Phase 1 Re-Evaluation

**Date**: 2025-12-09  
**Artifacts Generated**: research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml, quickstart.md

| Principle | Status | Post-Design Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| **I. Simplicity & Clarity** | ✅ PASS | Data model is straightforward (4 entities). SQLite schema uses simple indexed queries. No over-engineering detected. |
| **II. Generic & Modular** | ✅ PASS | Pydantic models are reusable. Service layer cleanly separated. Adding new metrics requires only configuration changes (no code). OpenAPI contract enables future client generation. |
| **III. Transparency & Documentation** | ✅ PASS | OpenAPI spec documents all 6 endpoints with schemas, examples, error codes (100% coverage per SC-007). quickstart.md provides setup instructions, API examples, and troubleshooting. data-model.md documents all entities and database schema. |
| **IV. Testing & Validation** | ✅ PASS | Test structure defined in project layout (contract, integration, unit tests). Pydantic models enforce validation at API boundaries. |
| **V. Open Collaboration** | ⚠️ DEFERRED | Ruff configuration ensures code style consistency. Still deferred: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, PR review process. |
| **VI. Security & Data Privacy** | ✅ PASS | Confirmed: all data is synthetic. Input validation enforced by Pydantic (well_id pattern, enum types, range constraints). No credentials in design. |
| **VII. Developer Experience** | ✅ PASS | quickstart.md documents manual setup. Dev Container configuration MUST be implemented (non-negotiable per constitution). Will include Python 3.14 base image, uv installation, all dependencies, VS Code extensions (Python, Ruff), and database initialization in postCreateCommand. |

**Final Gate Decision**: ✅ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION — Design satisfies all core technical principles. One deferred item (V: collaboration guidelines) does not block MVP delivery. Dev Container is required and will be implemented.

**Structure Decision**: Single backend API project. No frontend or mobile components. This is a pure REST API service with synthetic data generation, SQLite storage, and FastAPI routes. The modular structure separates models (data schemas), services (business logic), api (HTTP layer), and db (persistence) to support independent testing and future extensibility.

| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
